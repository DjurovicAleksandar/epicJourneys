# epicJourneys

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Epic Journeys! 
This website is built using the latest web technologies such as React, Tailwind, Vite, and Firebase. 
I utilized Firebase Firestore and Storage, as well as the restCountries API, to create a fast and efficient user experience.

As an admin, you can log in using the login button and access the option to add a new destination. 
The login email is admin@epicjourneys.com and the password is adminadmin. 

Additionally, I used Firebase Hosting to host this website, providing a secure and reliable platform for users to access.

Please feel free to explore the codebase and website at:

I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve the site's functionality or design. Thank you for visiting my repository!
